Todo App

A simple yet powerful Todo application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Context API. This app allows you to manage your tasks efficiently with features like adding, updating, deleting, and toggling the completion status of todos. All data is stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring your tasks persist even after refreshing the page.

Features
Add Todo: Quickly add new tasks to your list.
Delete Todo: Remove tasks that you no longer need.
Update Todo: Edit the content of existing tasks.
Toggle Complete Todo: Mark tasks as completed or uncompleted. The styling of the todo changes based on its completion status.
Persist Todos: All todos are stored in the browser's local storage, so your tasks are always saved until deleted.

Tech Stack
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
Context API: For managing state across components without prop drilling.
Local Storage: For persisting todo data in the browser.

State Management
All functionalities such as adding, deleting, updating, and toggling todos are managed using the Context API. This approach eliminates the need for prop drilling and ensures a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.
